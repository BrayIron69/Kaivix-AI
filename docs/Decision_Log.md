\# Purpose



This document records significant architectural, technical, and product decisions made during the development of Kaivix Core.



The purpose is to preserve the reasoning behind important decisions so they are not revisited unnecessarily.



Every major architectural or product decision should be documented here.



\---



\# Decision Format



Every decision follows this structure.



\---

\*\*Title\*\*



\*\*Date\*\*



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded



\### Context

\### Decision



What was decided?



\### Reasoning



Why was this chosen?



\### Consequences

\# Decision #001



\## Python Owns Business Logic



\*\*Date\*\*



2026-07-25



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted



\### Context



Business decisions must remain predictable and testable.



\### Decision



All deterministic business logic will be implemented in Python.



\### Reasoning



Language models can be inconsistent.



Business rules require deterministic behavior.



Python provides validation, testing, debugging, and predictable execution.



\### Consequences



Benefits



\- Predictable behavior

\- Easier testing

\- Better debugging

\- Easier maintenance



Trade-offs



\- More Python code

\- Less prompt-driven logic



\---



\# Decision #002



\## LLM Generates Language Only



\*\*Date\*\*



2026-07-25



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted



\### Context



Language models excel at communication but should not control application behavior.



\### Decision



The LLM is responsible only for generating natural language.



\### Reasoning



The AI should communicate decisions rather than make business decisions.



Business workflows remain deterministic.



\### Consequences



Benefits



\- Reliable workflows

\- Easier debugging

\- Lower hallucination risk



Trade-offs



\- Additional application logic required



\---



\# Decision #003



\## Configuration Over Customization



\*\*Date\*\*



2026-07-25



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted



\### Context



Kaivix Core will support many businesses.



Hardcoding customer-specific behavior is not scalable.



\### Decision



Customers will customize behavior through configuration instead of modifying source code.



\### Reasoning



Configuration enables rapid onboarding and reduces maintenance.



\### Consequences



Benefits



\- Easier onboarding

\- Cleaner architecture

\- Better scalability



Trade-offs



\- Larger configuration system



\---



\# Decision #004



\## Modular Architecture



\*\*Date\*\*



2026-07-25



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted



\### Context



Large software projects become difficult to maintain when responsibilities overlap.



\### Decision



Each component must have one primary responsibility.



\### Reasoning



Smaller modules are easier to understand, test, and extend.



\### Consequences



Benefits



\- Better maintainability

\- Easier testing

\- Simpler debugging



Trade-offs



\- More modules



\---



\# Decision #005



\## Conversation Engine Is the Orchestrator



\*\*Date\*\*



2026-07-25



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted



\### Context



The system requires a single coordinator for conversation flow.



\### Decision



ConversationEngine coordinates all major components.



\### Reasoning



Central orchestration simplifies communication between independent modules.



\### Consequences



Benefits



\- Clear execution flow

\- Better separation of responsibilities



Trade-offs



\- ConversationEngine must remain lightweight



\---



\# Decision #006



\## MemoryManager Is the Single Memory Entry Point



\*\*Date\*\*



2026-07-25



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted



\### Context



Multiple memory modules require centralized management.



\### Decision



MemoryManager becomes the only component responsible for coordinating memory operations.



\### Reasoning



Centralized access prevents inconsistent memory handling.



\### Consequences



Benefits



\- Cleaner interfaces

\- Easier maintenance

\- Future extensibility



Trade-offs



\- MemoryManager becomes a critical component



\---



\# Decision #007



\## Planning Before Response Generation



\*\*Date\*\*



2026-07-25



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted



\### Context



The AI should determine its objective before generating language.



\### Decision



Planning occurs before PromptBuilder and the LLM.



\### Reasoning



Responses should be driven by goals rather than generated spontaneously.



\### Consequences



Benefits



\- Goal-driven conversations

\- Better lead qualification

\- More consistent behavior



Trade-offs



\- Slightly more processing



\---



\# Decision #008



\## BusinessConfig Will Drive Customer Customization



\*\*Date\*\*



2026-07-25



\*\*Status\*\*



Accepted



\### Context



Future customers should not require source code modifications.



\### Decision



Business-specific settings will be stored inside BusinessConfig.



\### Reasoning



BusinessConfig enables reusable deployments.



\### Consequences



Benefits



\- Rapid customer onboarding

\- Reduced maintenance

\- Platform scalability



Trade-offs



\- More complex configuration system



\---



\# Future Decisions



Every important architectural, product, or engineering decision should be recorded here before implementation.



Examples



\- Multi-tenant architecture

\- Plugin system

\- Vector database adoption

\- Calendar provider abstraction

\- CRM abstraction

\- Voice AI architecture

\- Analytics architecture

\- Deployment strategy

\- Security architecture



\---



\# Rules



1\. Never delete historical decisions.



2\. If a decision changes:



\- Mark the original as Superseded.

\- Add a new decision.



3\. Record the reasoning, not only the outcome.



4\. Significant architectural discussions should result in a documented decision.



5\. This document is the historical record of Kaivix Core.
